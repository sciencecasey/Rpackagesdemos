# Rpackagesdemos
Links at the top of each script for the source of instructions

I do not own any of the demos and simply have followed them and added notes that I find helpful. 

I also have some simple scripts from parsing commands I found useful but complicated, mostly from searching answers in stackexchange (same username)

I hope they can be helpful to others as well
